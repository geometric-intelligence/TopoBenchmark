## :pushpin: Overview

`TopoBenchmarkX` (TBX) is a modular Python library designed to standardize benchmarking and accelerate research in Topological Deep Learning (TDL). In particular, TBX allows to train and compare the performances of all sorts of Topological Neural Networks (TNNs) across the different topological domains, where by _topological domain_ we refer to a graph, a simplicial complex, a cellular complex, or a hypergraph.

<p align="center">
  <img src="resources/workflow.jpg" width="700">
</p>

The main pipeline trains and evaluates a wide range of state-of-the-art TNNs and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (see <a href="#gear-neural-networks">:gear: Neural Networks</a>) on numerous and varied datasets and benchmark tasks (see <a href="#books-datasets">:books: Datasets</a> ). 

Additionally, the library offers the ability to transform, i.e. _lift_, each dataset from one topological domain to another (see <a href="#rocket-liftings">:rocket: Liftings</a>), enabling for the first time an exhaustive inter-domain comparison of TNNs.

## :jigsaw: Get Started

### Create Environment

If you do not have conda on your machine, please follow [their guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/) to install it. 

First, clone the `TopoBenchmarkX` repository and set up a conda environment `tbx` with python 3.11.3. 

```
git clone git@github.com:pyt-team/topobenchmarkx.git
cd TopoBenchmarkX
conda create -n tbx python=3.11.3
```

Next, check the CUDA version of your machine:
```
/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc --version
```
and ensure that it matches the CUDA version specified in the `env_setup.sh` file (`CUDA=cu121` by default). If it does not match, update `env_setup.sh` accordingly by changing both the `CUDA` and `TORCH` environment variables to compatible values as specified on [this website](https://github.com/pyg-team/pyg-lib).

Next, set up the environment with the following command.

```
source env_setup.sh
```
This command installs the `TopoBenchmarkX` library and its dependencies. 

### Run Training Pipeline

Next, train the neural networks by running the following command:

```
python -m topobenchmarkx 
```

Thanks to `hydra` implementation, one can easily override the default experiment configuration through the command line. For instance, the model and dataset can be selected as:

```
python -m topobenchmarkx model=cell/cwn dataset=graph/MUTAG
```

**Remark:** By default, our pipeline identifies the source and destination topological domains, and applies a default lifting between them if required.

The same CLI override mechanism also applies when modifying more finer configurations within a `CONFIG GROUP`. Please, refer to the official [`hydra`documentation](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) for further details.

## :bike: Experiments Reproducibility
To reproduce Table 1 from the `TopoBenchmarkX: A Framework for Benchmarking Topological Deep Learning` paper, please run the following command:

```
bash scripts/reproduce.sh
```
**Remark:** We have additionally provided a public W&B (Weights & Biases) project with logs for the corresponding runs (updated on June 11, 2024).

## :gear: Neural Networks

We list the neural networks trained and evaluated by `TopoBenchmarkX`, organized by the topological domain over which they operate: graph, simplicial complex, cellular complex or hypergraph. Many of these neural networks were originally implemented in [`TopoModelX`](https://github.com/pyt-team/TopoModelX).

## :rocket: Liftings

We list the liftings used in `TopoBenchmarkX` to transform datasets. Here, a _lifting_ refers to a function that transforms a dataset defined on a topological domain (_e.g._, on a graph) into the same dataset but supported on a different topological domain (_e.g._, on a simplicial complex).

<details>
<summary><b> Topology Liftings </b></summary>

### Graph2Simplicial
| Name | Description | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CliqueLifting | The algorithm finds the cliques in the graph and creates simplices. Given a clique the first simplex added is the one containing all the nodes of the clique, then the simplices composed of all the possible combinations with one node missing, then two nodes missing, and so on, until all the possible pairs are added. Then the method moves to the next clique. | [Simplicial Complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_complex) |
| KHopLifting | For each node in the graph, take the set of its neighbors, up to k distance, and the node itself. These sets are then treated as simplices. The dimension of each simplex depends on the degree of the nodes. For example, a node with d neighbors forms a d-simplex. | [Neighborhood Complexes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0512077) |

### Graph2Cell
| Name | Description | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CellCycleLifting |To lift a graph to a cell complex (CC) we proceed as follows. First, we identify a finite set of cycles (closed loops) within the graph. Second, each identified cycle in the graph is associated to a 2-cell, such that the boundary of the 2-cell is the cycle. The nodes and edges of the cell complex are inherited from the graph. | [Appendix B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00606) |

### Graph2Hypergraph
| Name | Description | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KHopLifting | For each node in the graph, the algorithm finds the set of nodes that are at most k connections away from the initial node. This set is then used to create an hyperedge. The process is repeated for all nodes in the graph. | [Section 3.4](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9264674) |
| KNearestNeighborsLifting | For each node in the graph, the method finds the k nearest nodes by using the Euclidean distance between the vectors of features. The set of k nodes found is considered as an hyperedge. The proces is repeated for all nodes in the graph. | [Section 3.1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9264674) |

## :hammer_and_wrench: Development

To join the development of `TopoBenchmarkX`, you should install the library in dev mode. 

For this, you can create an environment using either conda or docker. Both options are detailed below.

### :snake: Using Conda Environment

Follow the steps in <a href="#jigsaw-get-started">:jigsaw: Get Started</a>.


### :whale: Using Docker

For ease of use, TopoBenchmarkX employs <img src="https://github.com/wesbos/Font-Awesome-Docker-Icon/blob/master/docker-white.svg" width="20" height="20"> [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). To set it up on your system you can follow [their guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). once installed, please follow the next steps:

First, clone the repository and navigate to the correct folder.
```
git clone git@github.com:pyt-team/topobenchmarkx.git
cd TopoBenchmarkX
```

Then, build the Docker image.
```
docker build -t topobenchmarkx:new .
```

Depending if you want to use GPUs or not, these are the commands to run the Docker image and mount the current directory.

With GPUs
```
docker run -it -d --gpus all --volume $(pwd):/TopoBenchmarkX topobenchmarkx:new
```

With CPU
```
docker run -it -d --volume $(pwd):/TopoBenchmarkX topobenchmarkx:new
```

Happy development!
