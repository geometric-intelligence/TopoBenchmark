## :pushpin: Overview

`TopoBenchmark` (TB) is a modular Python library designed to standardize benchmarking and accelerate research in Topological Deep Learning (TDL). In particular, TB allows to train and compare the performances of all sorts of Topological Neural Networks (TNNs) across the different topological domains, where by _topological domain_ we refer to a graph, a simplicial complex, a cellular complex, or a hypergraph. For detailed information, please refer to the [`TopoBenchmark: A Framework for Benchmarking Topological Deep Learning`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06642) paper.

<p align="center">
  <img src="resources/workflow.jpg" width="700">
</p>

The main pipeline trains and evaluates a wide range of state-of-the-art TNNs and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (see <a href="#gear-neural-networks">:gear: Neural Networks</a>) on numerous and varied datasets and benchmark tasks (see <a href="#books-datasets">:books: Datasets</a> ). Through TopoTune (see <a href="#bulb-topotune">:bulb: TopoTune</a>), the library provides easy access to training and testing an entire landscape of graph-based TNNs, new or existing, on any topological domain.

Additionally, the library offers the ability to transform, i.e. _lift_, each dataset from one topological domain to another (see <a href="#rocket-liftings">:rocket: Liftings</a>), enabling for the first time an exhaustive inter-domain comparison of TNNs.

## :jigsaw: Get Started

### Create Environment

If you do not have conda on your machine, please follow [their guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/) to install it. 

First, clone the `TopoBenchmark` repository and set up a conda environment `tb` with python 3.11.3. 

```
git clone git@github.com:geometric-intelligence/topobenchmark.git
cd TopoBenchmark
conda create -n tb python=3.11.3
```

Next, check the CUDA version of your machine:
```
/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc --version
```
and ensure that it matches the CUDA version specified in the `env_setup.sh` file (`CUDA=cu121` by default). If it does not match, update `env_setup.sh` accordingly by changing both the `CUDA` and `TORCH` environment variables to compatible values as specified on [this website](https://github.com/pyg-team/pyg-lib).

Next, set up the environment with the following command.

```
source env_setup.sh
```
This command installs the `TopoBenchmark` library and its dependencies. 

### Run Training Pipeline

Next, train the neural networks by running the following command:

```
python -m topobenchmark 
```

Thanks to `hydra` implementation, one can easily override the default experiment configuration through the command line. For instance, the model and dataset can be selected as:

```
python -m topobenchmark model=cell/cwn dataset=graph/MUTAG
```

**Remark:** By default, our pipeline identifies the source and destination topological domains, and applies a default lifting between them if required.

The same CLI override mechanism also applies when modifying more finer configurations within a `CONFIG GROUP`. Please, refer to the official [`hydra`documentation](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) for further details.

## :bike: Experiments Reproducibility
To reproduce Table 1 from the [`TopoBenchmark: A Framework for Benchmarking Topological Deep Learning`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06642) paper, please run the following command:

```
bash scripts/reproduce.sh
```
**Remark:** We have additionally provided a public [W&B (Weights & Biases) project](https://wandb.ai/telyatnikov_sap/TopoBenchmark_main?nw=nwusertelyatnikov_sap) with logs for the corresponding runs (updated on June 11, 2024).

## :gear: Neural Networks

We list the neural networks trained and evaluated by `TopoBenchmark`, organized by the topological domain over which they operate: graph, simplicial complex, cellular complex or hypergraph. Many of these neural networks were originally implemented in [`TopoModelX`](https://github.com/pyt-team/TopoModelX).

## :bulb: TopoTune

We include TopoTune, a comprehensive framework for easily defining and training new, general TDL models on any domain using any (graph) neural network ω as a backbone. The pre-print detailing this framework is [TopoTune: A Framework for Generalized Combinatorial Complex Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06530). In a GCCN (pictured below), the input complex is represented as an ensemble of strictly augmented Hasse graphs, one per neighborhood of the complex. Each of these Hasse graphs is processed by a sub model ω, and the outputs are rank-wise aggregated in between layers. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="resources/gccn.jpg" width="700">
</p>

### Defining and training a GCCN
To implement and train a GCCN, run the following command line with the desired choice of dataset, lifting domain (ex: `cell`, `simplicial`), PyTorch Geometric backbone model (ex: `GCN`, `GIN`, `GAT`, `GraphSAGE`) and parameters (ex. `model.backbone.GNN.num_layers=2`), neighborhood structure (routes), and other hyperparameters.


```
python -m topobenchmark \
    dataset=graph/PROTEINS \
    dataset.split_params.data_seed=1 \
    model=cell/topotune\
    model.tune_gnn=GCN \
    model.backbone.GNN.num_layers=2 \
    model.backbone.neighborhoods=\[1-up_laplacian-0,1-down_incidence-2\] \
    model.backbone.layers=4 \
    model.feature_encoder.out_channels=32 \
    model.feature_encoder.proj_dropout=0.3 \
    model.readout.readout_name=PropagateSignalDown \
    logger.wandb.project=TopoTune_cell \
    trainer.max_epochs=1000 \
    callbacks.early_stopping.patience=50 \
```

To use a single augmented Hasse graph expansion, use `model={domain}/topotune_onehasse` instead of `model={domain}/topotune`.

To specify a set of neighborhoods (routes) on the complex, use a list of neighborhoods each specified as `\[\[{source_rank}, {destination_rank}\], {neighborhood}\]`. Currently, the following options for `{neighborhood}` are supported:
- `up_laplacian`, from rank $r$ to $r$
- `down_laplacian`, from rank $r$ to $r$
- `boundary`, from rank $r$ to $r-1$
- `coboundary`, from rank $r$ to $r+1$
- `adjacency`, from rank $r$ to $r$ (stand-in for `up_adjacency`, as `down_adjacency` not yet supported in TopoBenchmark)


### Using backbone models from any package
By default, backbone models are imported from `torch_geometric.nn.models`. To import and specify a backbone model from any other package, such as `torch.nn.Transformer` or `dgl.nn.GATConv`, it is sufficient to 1) make sure the package is installed and 2) specify in the command line:

```
model.tune_gnn = {backbone_model}
model.backbone.GNN._target_={package}.{backbone_model}
```

### Reproducing experiments

We provide scripts to reproduce experiments on a broad class of GCCNs in [`scripts/topotune`](scripts/topotune) and reproduce iterations of existing neural networks in [`scripts/topotune/existing_models`](scripts/topotune/existing_models), as previously reported in the [TopoTune paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06530).

We invite users interested in running extensive sweeps on new GCCNs to replicate the `--multirun` flag in the scripts. This is a shortcut for running every possible combination of the specified parameters in a single command.

## :rocket: Liftings

We list the liftings used in `TopoBenchmark` to transform datasets. Here, a _lifting_ refers to a function that transforms a dataset defined on a topological domain (_e.g._, on a graph) into the same dataset but supported on a different topological domain (_e.g._, on a simplicial complex).

<details>
<summary><b> Topology Liftings </b></summary>

### Graph2Simplicial
| Name | Description | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CliqueLifting | The algorithm finds the cliques in the graph and creates simplices. Given a clique the first simplex added is the one containing all the nodes of the clique, then the simplices composed of all the possible combinations with one node missing, then two nodes missing, and so on, until all the possible pairs are added. Then the method moves to the next clique. | [Simplicial Complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_complex) |
| KHopLifting | For each node in the graph, take the set of its neighbors, up to k distance, and the node itself. These sets are then treated as simplices. The dimension of each simplex depends on the degree of the nodes. For example, a node with d neighbors forms a d-simplex. | [Neighborhood Complexes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0512077) |

### Graph2Cell
| Name | Description | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CellCycleLifting |To lift a graph to a cell complex (CC) we proceed as follows. First, we identify a finite set of cycles (closed loops) within the graph. Second, each identified cycle in the graph is associated to a 2-cell, such that the boundary of the 2-cell is the cycle. The nodes and edges of the cell complex are inherited from the graph. | [Appendix B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00606) |

### Graph2Hypergraph
| Name | Description | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KHopLifting | For each node in the graph, the algorithm finds the set of nodes that are at most k connections away from the initial node. This set is then used to create an hyperedge. The process is repeated for all nodes in the graph. | [Section 3.4](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9264674) |
| KNearestNeighborsLifting | For each node in the graph, the method finds the k nearest nodes by using the Euclidean distance between the vectors of features. The set of k nodes found is considered as an hyperedge. The proces is repeated for all nodes in the graph. | [Section 3.1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9264674) |
