=============

The API reference gives an overview of `TopoBenchmarkX`, which consists of several modules:

- `data` implements the utilities to download  load, and preprocess data, among other functionalities.
- `dataloader` implements custom dataloaders to generate batches from topological data.
- `evaluator` implements functionalities to evaluate the performances of the neural networks.
- `loss` implements the loss functions.
- `model` implements the classes to handle the neural networks.
- `nn` implements utilities regarding neural networks.
- `optimizer` implements funtionalities to manage both optimizers and schedulers.
- `transforms` implements utilities to preprocess datasets, including lifting procedures.
- `utils` implements utilities to handle the training process.
